Navigate to the docker folder with 
```
cd docker
```
Make sure to make both bash scripts excecutable using 

`chmod +x start.sh`

`chmod +x stop.sh`

You can start and stop the container using ./start.sh and ./stop.sh inside the docker folder respectively. Starting the container will also prune unused containers and images to optimise resource use.

Alternatively you can use 
    
    Start the container using 
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    Stop the container using
    ```
    docker stop mysql-container
    ```
    Access the mysql running in the container using 
    ```
    docker exec -it mysql-container mysql -u root -p
    ```

    To see if the container is running use
    ```
    docker ps
    ```
    You should get a result like this
    ```
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS              PORTS                                                  NAMES
    80fce21135dd   mysql:latest   "docker-entrypoint.s?"   2 hours ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, :::3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   mysql-container
    ```

    If any changes are made to the init.sql you need to stop the container and remove it using these two commands
    ```
    docker stop mysql-container
    docker rm mysql-container
    ```
